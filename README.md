# Expresso Notes

### Author: Emry McGill

## Description
A Progressive Web App for note-taking with offline functionality and seamless synchronization across devices. 

## Motivation
I wanted a really simple note app that I could use on the web, on my phone, and offline, to jot down ideas that come into my head. I couldn't find anything on the market that I liked so I took the opportunity to make one myself.

## What I learned
I learned about the technology of progressive web apps and how to make a website feel like a native mobile application. In addtion, I gained insight into offline synchronization techniques, specifically how to cache API calls when the user is offline and sync them back with the server once an internet connection is restored. This ensures that users can continue interacting with the app seamlessly, even in environments with poor or no connectivity.
